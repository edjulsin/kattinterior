## Project Overview

Katt is a visual-first portfolio and CMS built for an interior design studio. It combines Server-Side Rendering and Incremental Static Regeneration to deliver fast, SEO-friendly pages while handling large, high-resolution images efficiently.

The platform includes a custom drag-and-drop editor designed for non-technical users, producing clean, semantic HTML for both performance and search engines. Authentication and role-based access are handled with Supabase and enforced through Row-Level Security, while the UI is built with accessible components (Radix UI) and styled using Tailwind CSS.

Overall, the project focuses on delivering a production-ready, content-driven experience with strong performance, accessibility, and maintainable front-end architecture.
